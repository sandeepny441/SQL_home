-- NULLs and Joins â€“ WHERE vs ON
-- 13. Perform a RIGHT JOIN on dept and emp ON dept_id with hire_date > '2020-01-01' in ON clause to include all depts with NULLs where condition fails.
-- 14. Compare LEFT JOIN emp to dept ON dept_id with location = 'New York' in WHERE vs ON to see how NULL locations are handled.
-- 15. RIGHT JOIN emp to dept ON dept_id with salary > 70000 in ON vs WHERE, observing how NULL salaries affect row inclusion.
